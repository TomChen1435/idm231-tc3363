const writing_chicago_l = ['The Power of the Loop', 'Chicago\'s city center is famously named as "The Loop" after a transit infrastructure surrounding the blocks over the streets. This is another proof that the United States has never always been as car-centric as we know today - our public transit also had their days of prime. The Loop was a smart and efficient method before the through-running idea came along. It allows all trains to easily turn around and access more right-of-ways without building multiple termini or even dedicated turning loops, saving the city precious land area to develop more densely. When a train loops around the city center, it evenly distributes passengers to different sections of the area, avoiding over-crowding a small number of nodes.'];

const writing_septa_metro = ['Trains and Trolleys,<br>One Tunnel for All', 'When thinking of a quad-track underground tunnel for rapid transit in Philly, many would picture the section of the Broad Street Subway in North Philadelphia, where express trains blast through local stations at speed. To the west of the City Hall, the Market Street Tunnel achieves the same goal of level separation with a different approach. Despite all four tracks using the same 1,581mm Pennsylvanian trolley gauge, the local tracks are used by the Subway-Surface Trolleys, powered by overhead catenaries, while the third-rail-powered L goes express between City Hall and 30th Street. Together, the combination allows both faster trips in the urban core and more variety for destinations towards the southwest.'];

const writing_miami_metro = ['Transfer or Interline?', 'Like many metro systems in the U.S., Miami Metro advertises its services as if they were separate lines. Metrorail\'s system is a singular line with a one-stop branch. Usually, all trains interline to the south of Earlington Heights before the Orange Line branches off. On weekends, the Orange Line is replaced with a shuttle between the airport and the main line. The weekday strategy is common in the U.S. but not so much anywhere else, as most operators eventually realize how many disruptions can the interlining issues cause. Despite that, in this ever-ongoing debate of transfer vs. interline, the latter will always have some dedicated defenders for the benefits of more destinations with a single-seat ride.'];

const writing_la_metro = ['The Twin Subway Lines<br>in a Family of Light Rails', 'When it comes to downgrading in mass transit, no place would have more authority than Los Angeles. At one point in history, L.A.\'s Pacific Electric Railway was the largest electrified inter-urban railway system in the world. Today, Metrolink, the commuter rail system of L.A., is entirely diesel-powered, while this second largest city of the U.S. continues to struggle against the deeply rooted car-centrism from past urban planning. Similarly issues also affect the local rapid transit network. The A Line may proudly hold the title of the longest light rail line in the world, but the sheer scale of L.A. means so much more than justifying the need for additional fully-grade-separated heavy-rail lines like the B and the D.'];

const writing_bart = ['What Am I?<br>Maybe It Doesn\'t Matter...', 'There has been a long-standing argument about how to categorize the BART. Some say it\'s a rapid transit for its frequency of services, while others believe it\'s a commuter rail for the long distance between adjacent stations. Instead of drawing fixed boundaries for different modes of transit, we really should think of them as collections of spectrums and methods. Transit systems are designed similarly for the commonalities of cities but not the other way around - all details should vary and adapt to the environment. BART\'s planners truly did something visionary by respecting the Bay Area\'s urban layout and initiating this trend of "high-speed metro," which is becoming increasingly popular these days around the globe.'];
