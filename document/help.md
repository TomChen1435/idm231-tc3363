## Why do I make this? 

Heavy-rail rapid transit has been the most efficient way to transport a city's population since its creation. It is the perfect balance for passenger railways, combining the best of two worlds with the capacity of inter-urban railways and accessibility of urban trolleys.

The stories for this mode of transit in the United States have been through three phases since the turn of the 20th century, when cities like Chicago, Boston, New York, and Philadelphia all started to develop their unique plans for rail mass transit to fulfill the needs for intra-urban commutes with the growing urban areas and increasing population. Back then, these transit systems were mostly designed and built by private operators. The rail mass transit of a singular city often consisted of multiple systems run by separate companies. Unlike the chaos for the inter-city rail industry that led to different companies wasting tons of resources on the same corridor just to compete with one another, the limitations for urban terrains and governmental interventions made the operators utilize what they had and form more accessible networks that served more people among more communities.

The post-war days saw a massive decline for the U.S. railroad industry. Even the undisputed giants like Penn Central could not resist the waves of bankruptcy throughout the industry. In the meantime, the government started to take more responsibilities to protect our diversity of land transporation. The transition happened at the end of the 1960s when the Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO) Speedline opened between Camden, New Jersey and Philadelphia. Along with other national and international icons like the Washington Metro and the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), these brand new systems were designed to take an advantge of the more advanced technologies to better serve the more spread-out communities under the trend of suburbanism by combining the best of rapid transit and commuter rail. Therefore, the stations were farther apart from each other, while the trains were not only faster but also mostly automated, providing the commuters powerful alternatives in that car-centric era.

The following decades were very much of an extension for the previous phase. More cities that never had this mode of transit - Los Angeles, Miami, and Baltimore - opened their respective heavy-rail rapid transit for the first time, each coming up with an ambitious and extensive plan as a remedy for the gradually failing automobile-centric urban planning. However, severe public transit budget cuts at the same time put an abrupt end on this trend and forced more cities to pivot their focus toward more affordable alternatives, such as light rails. Fairly said, light rails may suit those smaller cities better, but the real issue is that those "light rail systems" in the U.S. are factually streetcars, which are proven to be more expensive and less capable compared to buses. They are like a band-aid set out to fix the long-standing wounds of our transportation for this country - it is never going to work.

As of now, I am sure you get the idea behind this project: the United States stopping to build heavy-rail metro systems for more cities does not mean the end for this mode of transit. Instead, we, as citizens and residents with a shared vision for a less car-dependent future, have the responsibility to advocate and convoy for those long-awaited and highly-anticipated construction projects throughout the nation:
